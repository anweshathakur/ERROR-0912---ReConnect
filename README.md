Thesis
RE:Connect is an AI-powered real estate opportunity intelligence system rather than a presentation tool. The platform is designed to help agents to find the best investment opportunity for a client.

The System Includes
Property Intelligence Engine
The backend system analyzes raw real estate data and converts it into investment-relevant metrics such as:

Price growth trends
Rental income potential
Demand indicators
Volatility and risk signals
Opportunity Scoring Model
Each property is processed through a scoring model that generates an Investment Opportunity Score.

This score is based on:

Historical appreciation
Yield potential
Market stability
Risk exposure
The result is a ranked list of properties instead of a raw database.
Investor Profiling System
Agents can input client preferences such as:

Budget
Risk tolerance
Investment goal (rental vs appreciation)
The system builds a structured investor profile that can be reused for future recommendations.

Matching & Recommendation Engine
This module matches:

Investor Profile ⇄ Scored Properties

It outputs:

Best-fit opportunities
Medium-fit options
High-risk alternatives
This transforms the agent’s role from manual searching to presenting curated opportunities.

AI Insight Generator
For every recommended property, the system generates a short, clear explanation such as:

“This property shows strong 5-year appreciation and above-average rental yield, making it suitable for moderate-risk investors seeking steady income.”

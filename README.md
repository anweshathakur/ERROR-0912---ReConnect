## Thesis

RE:Connect is an **AI-powered real estate opportunity intelligence system** rather than a presentation tool.
The platform is designed to help agents to find the best investment opportunity for a client.

### The System Includes

####  Property Intelligence Engine  
The backend system analyzes raw real estate data and converts it into **investment-relevant metrics** such as:

- Price growth trends  
- Rental income potential  
- Demand indicators  
- Volatility and risk signals  

---

#### Opportunity Scoring Model  
Each property is processed through a scoring model that generates an **Investment Opportunity Score**.

This score is based on:
- Historical appreciation  
- Yield potential  
- Market stability  
- Risk exposure  

The result is a **ranked list of properties** instead of a raw database.
---

#### Investor Profiling System  
Agents can input client preferences such as:

- Budget  
- Risk tolerance  
- Investment goal (rental vs appreciation)

The system builds a **structured investor profile** that can be reused for future recommendations.

---

#### Matching & Recommendation Engine  
This module matches:

**Investor Profile** ⇄ **Scored Properties**

It outputs:
- Best-fit opportunities  
- Medium-fit options  
- High-risk alternatives  

This transforms the agent’s role from **manual searching** to **presenting curated opportunities**.

---

####  AI Insight Generator  
For every recommended property, the system generates a short, clear explanation such as:

> “This property shows strong 5-year appreciation and above-average rental yield, making it suitable for moderate-risk investors seeking steady income.”

This makes insights:
- Client-friendly  
- Easy to explain  
- Faster to act on

## 🛠 Detailed Tech Stack

## 🛠 Tech Stack

RE:Connect is built as a **data-driven and machine learning–assisted system** for analyzing real estate investment opportunities.

###  Machine Learning
Machine learning is used to support property evaluation and opportunity scoring.

**Key uses:**
- Predicting property price growth trends  
- Estimating rental yield potential  
- Identifying high-demand vs low-demand areas  
- Detecting market risk patterns from historical data  

These outputs contribute to the **Investment Opportunity Score**, which ranks properties based on investment potential.

---

### Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter Notebooks are used during development for:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Training and testing ML models  
- Visualizing trends and model outputs  

This allows rapid experimentation before integrating the logic into the system.

---

###  Data Sources
- Public real estate datasets  
- Historical price data  
- Rental market statistics  
- Area-level demand indicators  

---

### AI Insight Layer
Used to generate short natural-language summaries explaining:
- Why a property is recommended  
- Key advantages  
- Possible risks  

---

###  Interface (Prototype)
A simple dashboard interface is used to display:
- Ranked properties  
- Investment scores  
- Market trend visualizations
